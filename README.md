# This project demonstrates a full BI solution for a small private school.
The data warehouse is redesigned using the star schema and demonstrates a simple ETL process, pulling data from the original data warehouse in Microsoft Azure into the newly designed data warehouse.
ETL logging to track the progression of the ETL process is demonstrated and shown in a report using SSRS.
Views are then created from the new data warehouse for the tabular model.
